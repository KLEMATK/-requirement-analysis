 “Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”
 Requirement analysis in software development is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining 
 the functional and non-functional needs of a software system. It involves close collaboration with stakeholders,
 such as clients, users, and developers, to understand what the software must do and the constraints it must operate under. 
 This phase ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals, serving as the foundation 
 for design, development, and testing. A well-executed requirement analysis helps prevent costly changes later in the project 
 and improves the overall quality and success of the software.
